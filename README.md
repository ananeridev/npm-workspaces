## What is NPM Workspaces?

NPM Workspaces is a feature introduced in npm 7+ that allows you to manage multiple packages (or projects) within a single repository (monorepo). It simplifies dependency management and linking between packages, making it easier to work with multiple interdependent modules.

Why Use NPM Workspaces?

ðŸ“¦ Centralized dependency management â€“ Install dependencies once at the root instead of per package.

ðŸ”— Automatic linking â€“ Packages within the workspace are linked automatically.

ðŸš€ Efficient monorepo development â€“ Helps in managing multiple related packages in a single repo.
